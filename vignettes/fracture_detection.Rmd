This vignette describes the application of the fracture detection package
to an outcrop photo. Several examples are provided in the data folder, including
two hand samples, one outcrop window, and a larger section of an outcrop. This
package hasn't been optimized for speed at all, so is embarassingly slow for
larger outcrops. Be warned.
